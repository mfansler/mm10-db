# mm10-db

This repository provides a Snakemake pipeline to download and transform mm10-related reference files that are used in bioinformatics workflows.
Among the derivable files include:

- UCSC genome FASTA
- GENCODE GFFs/GTFs
- salmon and kallisto indices
- filtered versions of GENCODE (protein-coding, verified 3'-ends)
- truncated versions of transcriptome annotations (used for 3'-end tag-based RNA-seq)

This serves as a record of data provenance.
